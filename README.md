# 📊 Marketing Analytics Portfolio  

This repository showcases my **Marketing Analytics project** using **Google BigQuery, SQL, and Google Sheets**.  
The project explores **e-commerce data** to analyze traffic sources, device performance, and product sales, followed by visualizations for business insights.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

In this project, I worked with **Google Analytics 4 sample e-commerce dataset** hosted on BigQuery.  
The analysis focuses on:  
1. Identifying **top traffic sources** driving sessions & revenue.  
2. Evaluating **conversion rates across devices** (desktop, mobile, tablet).  
3. Finding the **top 10 products** by revenue contribution.  

The final results were visualized in **Google Sheets charts** and presented in a mini portfolio website (via GitHub Pages).
